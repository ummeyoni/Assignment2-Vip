    <h1>Cox's Bazar</h1>
    <p>Cox’s Bazar is a town on the southeast coast of Bangladesh. It’s known for its very long, sandy beachfront, stretching from Sea Beach in the north to Kolatoli Beach in the south. Aggameda Khyang monastery is home to bronze statues and centuries-old Buddhist manuscripts. South of town, the tropical rainforest of Himchari National Park has waterfalls and many birds. North, sea turtles breed on nearby Sonadia Island.Surfing Cox's Bazar town though a small one, yet the same is a town of heritage. The sailor 'Captain Cox' explored the locality to name it on his own name. The local people both domiciled Burmese and Chittagonian lives in harmony. The major people are moderate Muslims but 'Buddhists' also live there. Be aware that at the local Buddhist temple, local non-Buddhist Bangladeshis will follow you around giving you a 'tour,' then demand money. This money of course goes in their pocket and not to the temple in any way. </p>
